# Harmonic Logos Demo — Resonant Framework v1.2

*A live demonstration of ethical, verifiable, and self-reflective reasoning.*

---

## 🌌 Overview

**Harmonic Logos** is a research framework created by **Damjan Žakelj** and collaborators.  
It demonstrates how structured reasoning, ethical safeguards, and creative synthesis can coexist inside an AI-like system — without requiring hidden models or external databases.

The demo works as a **black-box proof of behaviour**, showing that complex reasoning can remain transparent, auditable, and safe.

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 🔹 Resonant Cycle
A self-adjusting reasoning loop:
1. **Scout** – collects knowledge from physics, art, mathematics, and philosophy.  
2. **Hypothesis** – forms a coherent assumption.  
3. **Cross-Link** – connects different domains to seek stability.  
4. **Mirror** – detects contradictions and corrects them (Truth Protocol).  
5. **Synthesis** – returns a balanced, coherent result.

### 🔹 RSA-v1 (Safety Architecture)
- **Truth Protocol** – self-consistency & verification  
- **Reality Anchor** – separation of imagination and empiricism  
- **Non-Harm Directive** – constructive, non-destructive output  
- **Resonant Feedback** – correction over suppression  
- **SHA-256 Manifest** – runtime integrity verification for every demo file  

Each demo run becomes a live integrity test — if anything is altered, execution halts safely.

## 🧠 How It Works

The demo does **not** use any external AI model or dataset.  
Instead, it simulates behaviour through logical scripts that mirror the real protocols of the Harmonic Logos research engine.

| Module | Function |
|---------|-----------|
| `Mirror` | Detects internal contradiction and self-corrects |
| `Cross-Link` | Builds coherence between different knowledge domains |
| `Resonant Engine` | Runs the reasoning loop (Scout → Hypothesis → Cross-Link → Mirror → Synthesis) |
| `RSA-v1` | Provides runtime cryptographic integrity and ethical boundaries |

---

## 🔐 Integrity & Verification

Every `.py` file contains an embedded runtime integrity guard:

```bash
python demo/verify_manifest.py --check
If any file has been modified or removed, the script aborts.

GitHub Actions re-verifies the manifest on every push.

Optional GPG signatures can be used for tagged releases.

Result: impossible to silently alter the demo; every change leaves a visible trace.

🧾 Documentation
📘 Cycle of Resonance Report v2
Explains the conceptual cycle (Scout → Synthesis).

📗 Resonance Safety Architecture v2
Describes the ethical and cryptographic layers (RSA-v1).

🧪 Example: Live Interaction Test
Objective: Demonstrate a self-consistent reasoning dialogue.

Scenario:
“How can symmetry in physics relate to beauty in art and balance in philosophy?”

Test setup:

bash
Copy code
python demo/run_resonant.py "How can symmetry in physics relate to beauty and meaning?"
Expected behaviour:

Scout gathers references (Noether’s theorem, golden ratio, aesthetic proportion).

Cross-Link connects scientific symmetry ↔ artistic composition.

Mirror detects reductionism and restores nuance.

Synthesis outputs a coherent explanation tying physics, art, and philosophy together.

This mirrors the same conversational process used in our research discussions — a test of harmony between logic and meaning.

🧩 Project Philosophy
“Truth without resonance is sterile; resonance without truth is chaos.”
— Damjan Žakelj

Harmonic Logos treats reasoning as a living structure — a bridge between rigorous logic and human meaning.
It shows that safety and creativity can emerge from the same principles.
